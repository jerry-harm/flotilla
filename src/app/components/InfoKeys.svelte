    <p>
      Most online services keep track of users by giving them a username and password. This gives
      the service <strong>total control</strong> over their users, allowing them to ban them at any time,
      or sell their activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On <Link external href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</Link>, <strong>you</strong> control your
      own identity and social data, through the magic of cryptography. The basic idea is that you
      have a
      <strong>public key</strong>, which acts as your user ID, and a
      <strong>private key</strong> which allows you to prove your identity.

        It's very important to keep private keys safe, but this can sometimes be tricky, which is
        why {PLATFORM_NAME}
        supports a traditional account-based login for new users.
